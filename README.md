# Week 11

✏️ Our team collected data of similar underwater robots abroad, conducted comparative analysis, found out the advantages of each amphibious robot, made a summary, and applied these advantages to the robot we designed. We also discussed and identified the shortcomings of these robots, and summarized them so that the robots we designed could avoid these shortcomings and highlight the innovation and advantages of the robots we designed.
